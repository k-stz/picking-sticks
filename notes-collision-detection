explicit representation,
objects represented by polygons, through their points, edges and faces

implicit representation,
geometrical objects such as spheres, cones, cylinders, tori (pl. torus), etc. which
can't be explicitly represented but implicitly through a mathamatical expression:

implicit representation are usually represented as a mapping from 3d-space to 1d-real-numbers
like so:

[first, new, cool, math thing!]

f:R^3 -> R, where points given:
f(x,y,z) // our R^3
will evaluate into three regions,
zero:
f(x,y,z) = 0 // boundry of the object
f(x,y,z) > 0 // exterior of the object
f(x,y,z) < 0 // interior of the object

awesome!

An object boundry definied in such a way is called an /implicit surface/!

Advantages:
- quick rejection culling (is it interior = CULL it out!)
- fast intersection test: well simply feed a point into the f(x,y,z) function and you know
  if it is inside or toughing the boundry: f(x,y,z) =< 0!
