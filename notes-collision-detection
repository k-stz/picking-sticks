explicit representation,
objects represented by polygons, through their points, edges and faces

implicit representation,
geometrical objects such as spheres, cones, cylinders, tori (pl. torus), etc. which
can't be explicitly represented but implicitly through a mathematical expression:

implicit representation are usually represented as a mapping from 3d-space to 1d-real-numbers
like so:

[first, new, cool, math thing!]

f:R^3 -> R, where points given:
f(x,y,z) // our R^3
will evaluate into three regions zero, positive and negative:

f(x,y,z) = 0 // boundary of the object
f(x,y,z) > 0 // exterior of the object
f(x,y,z) < 0 // interior of the object

awesome!

Example for a sphere:
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= r^2    // works!

This is like a double Pythagorean theorem on the left side the resulting
distance is, if equal r^2, a point _on_ the sphere

(defun sphere-collision-p (x y z sphere-radius)
  "Returns true if the point P(x,y,z) lies within or touches the sphere of radius:
   sphere-radius."
  (<= (apply #'+
	     (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (expt x 2))
		     (list x y z)))
      (expt sphere-radius 2)))

Through understanding that this is just a double-pythagoras we can formulate a collision
test for a 2d-circle easily:
x^2 + y^2 <= r^2  (awesome number two!)

An object boundary defined in such a way is called an /implicit surface/!

Advantages:
- quick rejection culling (is it interior = CULL it out!)
- fast intersection test: well simply feed a point into the f(x,y,z) function and you know
  if it is inside or toughing the boundary: f(x,y,z) =< 0!

half-space,
we cut space in two along an infinite plane. The resulting two spaces left and right of
the plane are infinitely large but still just half-spaces of a bigger infinity!

convex objects (polygon),
any two points within this object can connect in a straight line without leaving the region of
the object. We need this word because collision tests are much easier with such objects!
Foreshadowing: we will probably try to break concave polygons into smaller convex objects?

concave polygon object,
opposite of convex object. Contains an interior angle greater than 180-degrees.

half-space intersection representation (convex objects only),
another way to represent polygonal objects, here we cut away some space with planes and use
the resulting half-space intersections to represent an object. An example would be to represent
a rectangle in 2d by using two x-axis values to cut away the two sides - resulting in an
infinitely long rectangle along the y axis- then provide two y-axis to encompass a finitely
big rectangle! (see texatl.cl:space for this kind of rectangle representation!)
This is reminiscent of the aabb test!
