v-sync can be had by (sdl2:gl-set-swap-interval 1) or -1


google: "opengl picking" and implement the simplest approach


ideas---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rubber like rectangle, can stretch along base axis at first, shouldn't be too hard
for a collision test


collision-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Have game-object transformation functions (move, scale, rotate) cache the new bounding
volume and or position. This allows for the main loop to perform collision tests with the
cached position and in the case of a collision to either not allow it (ai dodging bullets)
or calculate the penetration depth and point of collision and calculate a new position
where the two objects are merely touching (so game-objects don't penetrate walls but hug)!
