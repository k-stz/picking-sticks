;; After sufficient collision detection study you must move on to:

author: "will let you make an easy font atlas and extract the necessary metrics (â€¦) not GPU"

;; test with stumpwm live-editing
v-sync can be had by (sdl2:gl-set-swap-interval 1) or -1


google: "opengl picking" and implement the simplest approach


ideas---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rubber like rectangle, can stretch along base axis at first, shouldn't be too hard
for a collision test


scaling,
experimenting with rotation dependent scaling showed some neat effect when scaling individual
points of a rectangle. Make this an eye-candy feature.

frame freeze on collision,
"Whenever you hit a zombie the frame freezes for a short time, there is something
weirdly satifying about that" Test this mechanics once the rubber like collision 
works.


collision-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Have game-object transformation functions (move, scale, rotate) cache the new bounding
volume and or position. This allows for the main loop to perform collision tests with the
cached position and in the case of a collision to either not allow it (ai dodging bullets)
or calculate the penetration depth and point of collision and calculate a new position
where the two objects are merely touching (so game-objects don't penetrate walls but hug)!


Problems bulding the system on osx----------------------------------------------

;; quotes from users struggling to run on osx:
;; assumed problem with: cl-freetype

"using macports (...) it fails at "compiling cl-freetype""

;;compiled cl error: it can't find file ftsystem.h

(...) "do a global find for ftsystem.h? maybe it is not in 
	   /opt/local/include or /opt/local/include/freetype2?"
(...) "Those appears to be the places your compiler is checking"
